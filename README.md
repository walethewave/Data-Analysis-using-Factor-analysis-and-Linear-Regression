# **Data Analysis using Factor Analysis and Linear Regression**

## **Overview**
This repository provides a detailed analysis of a dataset related to the **dimensions of perfectionism** and their impact on **self-doubt**. Using **exploratory factor analysis (EFA)** and **multiple linear regression (MLR)**, this project uncovers the underlying factors of perfectionism and examines how they predict self-doubt.

---

## **Key Questions**
1. What are the primary factors underlying perfectionism?
2. How do specific dimensions of perfectionism predict self-doubt?
3. What are the implications of these findings for psychological interventions?

## **Methodology**
### **1. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)**
- **Objective**: Identify the underlying dimensions of perfectionism.
- **Results**:
  - **Four Factors** were identified:
    1. **Organization and Orderliness**
    2. **Fear of Failure and Concern over Mistakes**
    3. **Task Completion and Timeliness**
    4. **Striving for Excellence and High Standards**
  - These factors explained **50.3% of the total variance** in the data.

### **2. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**
- **Objective**: Examine how specific dimensions of perfectionism predict self-doubt.
- **Results**:
  - **Concern over Mistakes** and **Feelings of Failure** significantly predicted self-doubt.
  - The model explained **13.6% of the variance** in self-doubt.

---

## **Key Findings**
- **Factor Analysis**:
  - Four distinct dimensions of perfectionism were identified, each contributing uniquely to the overall construct.
- **Regression Analysis**:
  - **Feelings of Failure** had a stronger influence on self-doubt compared to **Concern over Mistakes**.

---

## **Implications**
- **Psychological Interventions**: Addressing feelings of failure and concern over mistakes may help reduce self-doubt in individuals with perfectionistic tendencies.
- **Future Research**: Longitudinal studies could further explore the causal relationships between perfectionism and self-doubt.
